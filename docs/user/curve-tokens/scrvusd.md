# <img src={ScrvusdLogo} className="heading-inline-logo" alt="scrvUSD" /> The scrvUSD Token 

scrvUSD is short for savings-crvUSD, and it functions like a bank savings account for crvUSD.  It is similar to other staked versions of USD stablecoins like sDOLA, sUSDS, sUSDe, etc.  Users can stake their crvUSD to receive scrvUSD, or swap for it directly.  Yield accrues automatically to scrvUSD holders, increasing the value of their tokens over time.

The yield comes from receiving a share of the crvUSD borrowing revenue.  The underlying crvUSD is not deployed to external pools or lending markets. It remains safely within the vault, minimizing risk.
