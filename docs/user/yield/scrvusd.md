# <img src={ScrvusdLogo} className="heading-inline-logo" alt="scrvUSD" /> Savings Vault (scrvUSD)



scrvUSD stands for “savings-crvUSD,” and works like a bank savings account for crvUSD. It is similar to other staked versions of USD stablecoins, such as sDAI, sUSDS, sUSDe, etc. Users can either stake their crvUSD to receive scrvUSD, or buy it directly on the market. Yield accrues automatically, increasing the value of their tokens over time.

scrvUSD is designed with minimal risk in mind. The underlying crvUSD deposited into the vault is not loaned out or deployed into other liquidity pools. Instead, it remains securely within the vault, minimizing risk for scrvUSD holders.

## How scrvUSD Works: Earn Savings on Your crvUSD

Think of scrvUSD as a specialized savings account for your crvUSD stablecoins. When you deposit crvUSD, you receive scrvUSD tokens in return. Over time, your scrvUSD tokens will automatically increase in value, meaning each scrvUSD token will represent more crvUSD than what you deposited.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Deposit crvUSD:** Send your crvUSD to the scrvUSD vault and receive scrvUSD tokens back.
2.  **Hold scrvUSD:** Simply hold onto your scrvUSD tokens in your wallet. There's no need to stake or lock them.
3.  **Earn Interest:** As you hold scrvUSD, its value against crvUSD steadily increases. This means your scrvUSD tokens are worth more crvUSD over time, reflecting the interest earned.
4.  **Withdraw crvUSD:** You can withdraw your crvUSD at any time. You'll receive your initial crvUSD deposit plus all the interest you've earned.

### How Much Will You Earn?

The interest rate (or yield) for scrvUSD is variable and adjusts regularly, typically every few days. You can view the current and historical rates directly on the [scrvUSD UI](https://www.curve.finance/crvusd/ethereum/scrvUSD/).  
For a detailed explanation of the different rate numbers you see on the interface, please refer to our FAQ: [What do the different APR/APY numbers on the UI mean?](scrvusd.mdx#what-do-the-different-aprapy-numbers-on-the-ui-mean)

Generally, the interest rate earned by scrvUSD holders is set to roughly match the average crvUSD borrowing rate from the previous week across all [crvUSD minting markets](https://www.curve.finance/crvusd/ethereum/markets/). However, if more than 50% of the total crvUSD supply is held as scrvUSD, the yield may be slightly diluted. You can see the current amount of crvUSD held as scrvUSD on our [Current scrvUSD Stats](../curve-tokens/scrvusd.mdx#current-scrvusd-stats) page.

### Where Does the Interest Come From?

The interest paid to scrvUSD holders originates from the fees paid by users who mint crvUSD against their collateral. These users pay a continuous borrowing interest rate as long as their loan is open.

scrvUSD receives up to 50% of these borrowing fees, the remaining portion going to the Curve DAO.

### What's the catch, why does Curve give out free money?

scrvUSD plays a crucial role in maintaining crvUSD's peg to $1. Its mechanics are designed to support the stability of the crvUSD stablecoin, making it an integral part of the wider crvUSD ecosystem. Further details on this aspect are explained below.

## Guides


:::info Important Note
While scrvUSD tokens exist and earn interest on all deployed networks, the deposit and withdrawal functions for the scrvUSD vault are exclusively available on the Ethereum mainnet. You can simply buy and sell scrvUSD from a curve pool and it will essentially have the same effect.
:::

### Depositing into the Savings Vault

Before you can start earning interest by depositing into the scrvUSD savings vault, you'll **need to have crvUSD tokens on the Ethereum mainnet**. If you have scrvUSD on any other chain, it will still earn interest, but you can't directly interact with the scrvUSD vault.

#### Step 1: Navigate to the scrvUSD Vault and Connect Your Wallet

Go to the official [scrvUSD vault page on Curve.finance](https://www.curve.finance/crvusd/ethereum/scrvUSD/):

<ButtonGrid buttonKeys={['gotoScrvusd']} />

Once on the page, connect your Web3 wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the interface.  After successfully connecting your wallet, you should see an interface similar to the following:

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="scrvUSD Whole UI"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/no-deposit-whole-ui-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/no-deposit-whole-ui-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '1684px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption>*Here we have 1000 crvUSD we can deposit, which can earn 6.9% APY*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Step 2: Choose Your Deposit Amount

On the left you'll see the `Deposit` tab. Here, enter the amount of crvUSD you wish to deposit, or click `Max` to deposit all your crvUSD from your wallet.

After entering your amount, you'll see how many scrvUSD vault tokens you'll receive. In the example below, if we deposit **1,000 crvUSD**, we would receive **953 scrvUSD**. This is because scrvUSD is designed to continuously grow in value against crvUSD (1 scrvUSD = 1.049 crvUSD).

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Deposit Amount"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/deposit-amount-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/deposit-amount-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '400px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Step 3: Approve & Deposit Your crvUSD

If this is your **first time depositing crvUSD into the scrvUSD vault**, you'll need to complete two separate transactions:

1.  **Approve:** This transaction gives the scrvUSD vault permission to access and transfer your crvUSD tokens from your wallet.
2.  **Deposit:** This second transaction actually sends your crvUSD into the vault, and in return, you'll receive scrvUSD tokens.

However, if you've deposited into the scrvUSD vault before, you'll only need to complete the **Deposit** transaction.

These transactions will appear sequentially in your Web3 wallet for you to review and sign. Once you've approved and sent both transactions, you'll see their progress displayed just below the deposit box on the interface:

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Deposit Success"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/deposit-success-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/deposit-success-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '400px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Congratulations! Your Deposit is Complete.

You've successfully deposited your crvUSD! In our example, you now hold **953.2 scrvUSD**. Remember, the scrvUSD token balance will not change, but the value of each scrvUSD token will automatically become worth *more* crvUSD over time, reflecting your earned interest.

### Checking Your Earned Interest

You can easily see how much interest you've earned directly on the scrvUSD UI:

1.  Navigate to the `Position Details` section.
2.  Hover your mouse over the `Your crvUSD Staked` box.

This will reveal the current crvUSD value of your scrvUSD holdings. For instance, here we see our initial **953 scrvUSD (which acquired by depositing 1,000 crvUSD)** is now worth **1,016 crvUSD after 3 months**, representing a gain of **16 crvUSD, or 1.6%**.

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Position Details"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/position-details-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/position-details-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '1000px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />

### Withdrawing from the Savings Vault

#### Step 1: Go to the scrvUSD Vault

You can withdraw your crvUSD from the vault at any time, there are **no delays or lock-ups**. Whenever you're ready to withdraw, simply navigate to the [scrvUSD vault page](https://www.curve.finance/crvusd/ethereum/scrvUSD/) on Curve.finance:

<ButtonGrid buttonKeys={['gotoScrvusd']} />

#### Step 2: Select Your Withdrawal Amount

Once on the scrvUSD vault page, click on the `Withdraw` tab located on the left side of the interface.

Here, you'll see your current scrvUSD balance. Enter the amount of scrvUSD you wish to withdraw, or click `Max`:

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Withdrawal Amount"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/withdraw-amount-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/withdraw-amount-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '400px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Notice that the amount of scrvUSD tokens remains the same (e.g., **953 scrvUSD** from our example). However, because scrvUSD continuously grows in value, the initial **1,000 crvUSD** deposit can now be withdrawn as **1,022 crvUSD** after a few months, a profit of **22 crvUSD**!

#### Step 3: Confirm and Complete Your Withdrawal

After you've selected your withdrawal amount, click the `Withdraw` button and confirm the transaction in your Web3 wallet.

Once this transaction is successfully confirmed on the blockchain, your crvUSD and earned interest will back in your wallet:

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Withdrawal Success"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/withdrawal-success-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/withdrawal-success-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '400px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Congratulations on successfully withdrawing your crvUSD and realizing your earned yield!

## FAQ

### What do the different APR/APY numbers on the UI mean?

When you visit the [scrvUSD UI](https://www.curve.finance/crvusd/ethereum/scrvUSD/), you'll see a dashboard similar to this:

<figure style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="scrvUSD statistics"
    sources={{
      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/statistics-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/savings/statistics-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '933px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

This interface displays several different numbers about the scrvUSD yield. Here's a breakdown of what each number means:

  * **Current APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** This is current annual interest rate you would earn, taking into account the effect of **compounding** interest (where your earnings also start earning interest).
  * **APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** This shows the current annual interest rate **without** factoring in compounding.
  * **7-day MA APR (7-day Moving Average APR):** This is the average simple interest rate (APR, without compounding) calculated over the past 7 days. It helps to smooth out daily fluctuations.
  * **Average APR:** This figure shows the average simple interest rate (APR, without compounding) over a user-selected time window. For example, if "1M" (1 month) is chosen in the bottom right corner of the UI, this number will reflect the average APR for the last month.

### Do the rewards mean I get more scrvUSD tokens over time?

No, you will always have the **same number of scrvUSD tokens**. What happens is that **each scrvUSD token becomes worth more crvUSD** as time goes on. So, when you sell your scrvUSD back, you get more crvUSD than you put in.

### Where does the yield come from?

The extra crvUSD you earn comes from **fees paid by people who borrow crvUSD**. A part of these fees is collected and given to scrvUSD holders like you through the system.

### Is scrvUSD locked when I deposit?

No, your scrvUSD is **never locked up**. You can take it out or swap it back to crvUSD whenever you want, without any waiting.

### Can the value of scrvUSD go down?

**No, not in the way you might think.** scrvUSD is designed to **always increase in value compared to crvUSD** because it's constantly earning yield.

However, if you decide to trade your scrvUSD for crvUSD (or another token) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) on any network, the actual price you get might be slightly less than its perfect theoretical value. This can happen because of how much crvUSD is available to trade at that moment (liquidity) or general market activity.

Also, it's always important to remember that while Curve uses the highest standards when creating its smart contracts, using any decentralized finance (DeFi) application, including scrvUSD, involves some risks. You can learn more about these risks here: [scrvUSD risks](../risks/scrvusd.md).

### I have scrvUSD on an L2, does it still earn interest?

Yes, absolutely! scrvUSD earns interest no matter which blockchain network it's on (like Ethereum, or an L2 such as Polygon or Arbitrum).

However, remember that the main scrvUSD vault for depositing and withdrawing is **only on Ethereum**. So, if your scrvUSD is on another network and you want to turn it back into crvUSD from the main vault, you'll need to either:

  * Move your funds back to the Ethereum network (this is called "bridging").
  * Or, you can simply swap your scrvUSD for crvUSD (or any other token) directly on Curve on the network you are currently on.
