# <img src={VecrvLogo} className="heading-inline-logo" alt="veCRV" /> veCRV - Claiming Revenue Share

Users who lock their CRV for veCRV will earn a portion of the revenue generated on Curve. **Every week within 24hrs after Thursday 00:00 UTC, the previous week's revenue is being distributed to veCRV holders to claim.** Revenue is mainly generated from two sources:

1.  **DEX Trades**: Each time a trade happens on Curve, a portion of trading fees are collected and distributed to veCRV holders.
2.  **crvUSD**: When a user borrows crvUSD from a [minting market](https://curve.finance/crvusd), portions of the interest paid is going to veCRV holders.

You can check the current veCRV metrics, estimated earnings, and historical data using the button below, or here: [veCRV Analytics](https://www.curve.finance/dao/ethereum/analytics/)

## Guide: How to Claim Your veCRV Revenue

### Claiming Eligibility

Before you can claim veCRV revenue, you need to meet the following criteria:

1.  **Have veCRV (locked CRV) in your wallet.**
    If you hold tokens from 'liquid lockers' (like cvxCRV, sdCRV, or yCRV), these are derivatives of veCRV. You'll need to claim your revenue through that specific project's website. If you don't have veCRV, see the guide on how to lock CRV here: [Guide: Locking CRV](../vecrv/how-to-lock.md).

2.  **You've held veCRV through a full revenue week (Thursday 00:00 UTC to Thursday 00:00 UTC).**
    Curve distributes revenue based on weekly snapshots. If you acquire veCRV on a Friday, for example, your first claim will be available roughly 13 days later.

### How to Claim Rewards

#### Step 1: Go to the veCRV Dashboard

Navigate to Curve's veCRV Dashboard (click below):

<ButtonGrid buttonKeys={['claimVecrvRevenue']} />

#### Step 2: Connect Wallet

If you have claimable revenue, it will be visible as shown below:

      light: require('@site/static/img/ui/dashboard/claim-revenue-light.png').default,
      dark: require('@site/static/img/ui/dashboard/claim-revenue-dark.png').default,
    }}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '400px',
      width: '100%'
    }}
  />

You may see two types of rewards:

    * **crvUSD**: All current and future DAO revenue is distributed as crvUSD.
    * **3CRV**: These are older rewards, discontinued on June 20th, 2024. Prior to crvUSD, revenue was distributed as 3CRV tokens (representing [3pool](https://www.curve.finance/dex/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit/) LP tokens). Only users who have not claimed in over a year will still see and be able to claim these rewards.

#### Step 3: Claim Rewards

Click on "Claim crvUSD" to initialize the claim transaction. After signing the transaction in your wallet, the rewards will be sent to your wallet.

Congratulations\! You've successfully claimed your portion of revenue as a Curve DAO member. Remember that your veCRV balance, and thus your rewards, are affected by how long is left on your CRV lock. Consider [re-locking your CRV](https://www.google.com/search?q=../vecrv/what-is-vecrv.md) to maintain your rewards.
